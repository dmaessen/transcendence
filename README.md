Before starting:
  Add the (keys) .env to the root of the project,
  Add the .env of database to /dot_env;

Then first 'make keys', then proceed with 'make build up' for instance.

This project runs in most browers, but specifically in chrome.
Run 'ifconfig' (if mac) within your terminal and then you can access the website via:
https://localhost:8443/ or taking the ip from env0 (from ifconfig) instead.
